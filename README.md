# 1. Purpose

This website allows me to showcase to a potential recruiter my skills when it comes to algorithms and Javascript.

# 2. Features / content

To serve this purpose, the recruitor will want to be able to:

1. Peer into my thinking / problem solving process: challenges should contain a section displaying this
2. The recruitor should get a sense of the different types of problems I have solved: there should be a filter by theme
3. Create some sort of a button that allows a recruitor to send me a challenge (like email me or something) that they think would be great for me to try to solve

# 3. Mockup

## 3.1. Mobile
